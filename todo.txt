sprites
=======
some random "town" objects
lamp

code
====
optional: code for launching a pause screen
occasional NPC spawning, either at random positions or by walking into the room from the edges of the room
game over on death

rooms
=====
game over screen?
two more levels?
narration screens for each level?

notes
=====
unless we end up having more than 1 level, saving/loading is probably unnecessary
 (although GM does have some save/load mechanics built into it)
toggling between fullscreen and windowed mode (via F11) is broken in the latest stable release of gamemaker.
