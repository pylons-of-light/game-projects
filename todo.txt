sprites
=======
reaper scythe attack? maybe just a "white slash" sprite appearing in front of the reaper.
some random "town" objects

code
====
optional: code for launching a pause screen
occasional NPC spawning, either at random positions or by walking into the room from the edges of the room
NPC interaction (with scythe)
NPC random "wandering" movement AI
NPC fleeing from reaper AI
health bar recharges when kill NPCs
game over on death
occasional random dialogue triggers for NPC and reaper

rooms
=====
a title screen, with our names and "New Day" and "Exit" buttons; links to first level
a single level, consisting of a small town at nighttime
narration intro/outro screens, with yes/no button in outro screen

notes
=====
unless we end up having more than 1 level, saving/loading is probably unnecessary
 (although GM does have some save/load mechanics built into it)
toggling between fullscreen and windowed mode (via F11) is broken in the latest stable release of gamemaker.
