code
====
code for starting a new level and exiting the game
occasional NPC spawning, either at random positions or by walking into the room from the edges of the room
NPC interaction (with scythe)
NPC random "wandering" movement AI
NPC fleeing from reaper AI
health bar recharges when kill NPCs
game over on death
clock, which shows 12:00 and counts down to 0:00 each second
optional: speech bubbles and text

rooms
=====
a title screen, with our names and "New Day" and "Exit" buttons
a single level, consisting of a small town at nighttime
optional: narration intro/outro screens, with yes/no button in outro screen


notes
=====
unless we end up having more than 1 level, saving/loading is probably unnecessary
 (although GM does have some save/load mechanics built into it)
toggling between fullscreen and windowed mode (via F11) is broken in the latest stable release of gamemaker.
